For recording:
Lets have a team member lead the meeting
and going forward we will alternate whos leading the meeting
seems like it has been a consistent comment
of the sponsors that we arent doing a good
job alternating whos leading the meeting

Other than that the sponsor eval turned out to be solid
seems like our communication has improved from
previous evals.
Lets continue strong rest of the semester
